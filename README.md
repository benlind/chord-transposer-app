# Chord Transposer

[See it live!](https://benlind.com/chord-transposer)

Transpose chord sheets in a web UI.

Note, I had to fork chord-transposer and install directly from github to add types to the package.json exports object.

## Deployment

To deploy, add a `deploy` shell script that uploads dist/ to a web server, and run `npm run deploy`.
